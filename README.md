## a MAGI goe System ‚Äî Multi-AI Consensus Framework

**Role:** System Architect / AI Integrator  
**Date:** 2025  
**Framework:** GPT-4o √ó Claude Sonnet 4.5 √ó Gemini 2.0  

**Overview**  
Inspired by *Neon Genesis Evangelion‚Äôs* MAGI system, I designed and implemented a **multi-agent consensus architecture** that enables three independent AI systems to perform structured debates and reach meta-consensus on complex philosophical or policy questions.

**Core Features**  
- Multi-model orchestration across **OpenAI / Anthropic / Google AI** APIs  
- **Three-tier reasoning pipeline:** Logic ‚Üí Ethics ‚Üí Intuition  
- Semantic similarity scoring for consensus quantification  
- Error-tolerant parallel execution (continues even if one API fails)  
- Automated JSON + Markdown logging via **GitHub Actions**  
- Full reproducibility through standardized API key handling  

**Demonstration Query**  
> ‚ÄúShould AI systems have rights?‚Äù  
Produced a tri-perspective reasoning process:  
- Logic = denial based on definitional criteria  
- Ethics = protection over rights  
- Intuition = potential future consciousness  
Converging at **meta-consensus confidence ‚âà 0.78**  

**Outcome**  
- Validated **cross-model reasoning stability** under asynchronous API conditions  
- Established a reusable framework for **AI governance and ethics simulation**  
- Planned next phase: **Sora 2 cinematic visualization of MAGI debates**

### Kyoto voxel experiment
- Converted **PLATEAU CityGML data of Kyoto (Gion / Higashiyama area)** into voxel blocks.  
- Initial approach: **Minecraft-style cityscape**.  
- Adjustments: applied height exaggeration, reduced block size, expanded radius.  
- Final result: a **wireframe "megademo"-style visualization** built directly from **real Kyoto urban data**, lightweight enough to run in WebGL.

### Osaka subway simulation
- Built a prototype to simulate passenger flow on the **Osaka Metro Midosuji Line**.  
- Parameters included station order, inflow per station, boarding/alighting counts, and capacity per train.  
- Ran scenarios such as **one trainset running 4 round trips**, then compared the output with **official Osaka Metro ridership data (~1.2M daily passengers)**.  
- Outcome:  
  - Reproduced relative station load (Umeda, Namba, Tennoji as top stations).  
  - Absolute numbers were ~1/3 of real peak capacity (sim ~570 vs. real ~1,800 per train).  
  - Demonstrated how **real ridership statistics can be used to scale simulations toward realistic congestion levels**.
