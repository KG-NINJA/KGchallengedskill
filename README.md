## OpenAI to Z Challenge — Jungle Anomaly Finder (NDVI Satellite Explorer)

**Role:** Independent Researcher / Builder  
https://www.kaggle.com/kgninja


**Timeline:** 2025  
**Format:** Selective, hackathon-style write-up track

# 📜 Resume Entry — Kaggle x OpenAI Hackathon

## OpenAI to Z Challenge (Kaggle × OpenAI, 2025)

- Participated in a **rare hackathon-style Kaggle competition** hosted by OpenAI.  
- **Format uniqueness**:  
  - Only **one submission per team allowed** (no retries).  
  - **English write-up required** with reproducibility and multi-source validation.  
  - Unlike typical Kaggle challenges, no official dataset was provided; participants had to gather and analyze open data independently.  
- **Scale and selectivity**:  
  - **8,156 entrants**, but only **229 final submissions** (<3%).  
  - Reached final submission despite being a first-time entrant — successfully completing a challenge with one of the **lowest completion rates in Kaggle history**.  
- **Skills demonstrated**:  
  - Research and integration of open satellite/LiDAR datasets.  
  - Analytical rigor under strict one-shot submission constraints.  
  - Clear communication and documentation in English for global reproducibility.

Built an end-to-end, open-source geospatial pipeline (NDVI anomaly detection + contextual layers) and completed a **final write-up submission** — one of the comparatively few participants who finished end-to-end within the time window.

  **Skills Demonstrated**  
- Sustained delivery across multiple checkpoints with strict deadlines  
- End-to-end geospatial pipeline design (data → analysis → visualization → reporting)  
- Reproducible research documentation in English  
- Project management and perseverance in a selective global competition

**Methods & Stack:** Python · NDVI/remote sensing · GIS (raster/vector) · Reproducible research workflows

*Advanced through all stages of the two-month, checkpoint-based hackathon (OpenAI to Z Challenge). 
The competition imposed strict one-submission rules, multiple deadlines, and rigorous compliance checks. 
At each checkpoint, many entrants dropped out due to documentation, reproducibility, and eligibility requirements. 
Successfully delivered a final write-up by the June 29th deadline, avoiding common disqualification pitfalls 
that eliminated a large share of participants.*

## Soham Interviewing Simulator — Challenge Log

https://github.com/KG-NINJA/soham.penrose/blob/main/readme.md

**Role:** Participant / Strategist  
**Timeline:** 2025  
**Format:** AI-based interview & negotiation simulator

**Overview**  
Completed an AI-powered interview simulation game modeled on real-world negotiation challenges.  
The simulator demanded **adaptability, negotiation skills, emotional intelligence, and strategic AI use**.  
Advanced to **Global Rank #34**, received multiple virtual offers, and successfully secured a top-tier "shramp" offer, which is known for its difficulty.

**Key Achievements**
- 🎯 Reached Overall Rank #34 globally  
- 💰 Negotiated a $110,000 finalized offer (missed a $140,000 offer by seconds)  
- 🦐 Achieved an offer from “shramp,” regarded as harder than Ramp (final-boss equivalent)  
- 📊 Sent 7 applications, received 2 confirmed offers (29% success rate)  
- ⚡ Demonstrated integrity-based playstyle in a system designed for deception — turning honesty into a winning strategy  

**Skills Demonstrated**
- Real-time adaptability in negotiation scenarios  
- Strategic use of AI tools combined with human intuition  
- Resilience under strict timeouts and high-pressure decision making  
- Cross-cultural communication and emotional intelligence
