## Abstract

We present **AIEO (AI Engine Optimization)**, a novel protocol enabling individuals to establish and maintain AI-discoverable digital identities without reliance on centralized platforms. By combining automated visibility tracking, concept memory inspired by ArcMemo (Google DeepMind, 2024), and self-sovereign identity principles, AIEO provides a lightweight, reproducible framework for personal presence in AI-mediated information ecosystems.

Our implementation demonstrates:
- **Autonomous daily visibility measurement** across search engines and AI platforms
- **Concept memory evolution** through X (Twitter) timeline harvesting
- **Zero-cost operation** via GitHub Actions automation
- **Complete transparency** through open-source release

Initial results show measurable growth in AI discoverability within 30 days of deployment, validating AIEO as a practical approach to personal identity management in the era of Large Language Models.

**Keywords:** AI Engine Optimization, Self-Sovereign Identity, Concept Memory, Digital Presence, Personal Autonomy

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered search engines has fundamentally altered how information is discovered and consumed. Traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO) focuses on Google's PageRank algorithm, but AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity employ fundamentally different retrieval mechanisms:

- **Semantic understanding** over keyword matching
- **Contextual reasoning** over link analysis  
- **Concept-based retrieval** over exact-match search

This shift creates a critical gap: **How can individuals ensure their work, ideas, and identity are discoverable by AI systems?**

Existing solutions fall short:
- **Corporate approaches** require substantial resources
- **Platform-dependent strategies** sacrifice autonomy
- **Blockchain-based identity** introduces unnecessary complexity

We propose **AIEO (AI Engine Optimization)**: a lightweight, self-sovereign protocol that enables individuals to:
1. Measure their AI visibility quantitatively
2. Evolve their identity representation autonomously
3. Maintain complete control over their digital presence

### 1.2 Core Philosophy: "PsychoFrame" Resonance

Drawing inspiration from Gundam's PsychoFrame technology—a system enabling human-machine resonance through mutual understanding—AIEO establishes a bidirectional communication channel between human creators and AI systems.

Rather than passive indexing, AIEO actively broadcasts "signals" (structured data pulses) that AI systems can discover, interpret, and remember.

### 1.3 Contributions

1. **AIEO Protocol Specification**: A five-layer architecture for AI visibility management
2. **Reference Implementation**: Fully functional system running in production since October 2025
3. **Open Source Release**: Complete codebase with reproducibility guarantee
4. **Empirical Validation**: 30-day measurement data demonstrating effectiveness

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Traditional SEO focuses on:
- **On-page optimization**: meta tags, headers, keywords
- **Off-page optimization**: backlinks, domain authority
- **Technical SEO**: site speed, mobile responsiveness

**Limitations for AI Era:**
- Designed for keyword-based retrieval
- Assumes crawler-based indexing
- No support for semantic understanding

### 2.2 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)

W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) enable individuals to control their digital identity without intermediaries.

**Key Technologies:**
- Verifiable Credentials
- Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
- Cryptographic proofs

**Limitations:**
- High implementation complexity
- Blockchain dependency
- Limited adoption outside enterprise

### 2.3 ArcMemo: Concept-Level Memory

Google DeepMind's ArcMemo (2024) introduced:
- **Open-Ended (OE) format**: Situation → Proposal
- **Program Synthesis (PS) format**: Input → Procedure
- **Concept abstraction**: Experience → Reusable knowledge

**Our Adaptation:**
- OE → "Visibility Pulse" (situation) + "Effect Analysis" (proposal)
- PS → "Memory Update" (input) + "Concept Evolution" (procedure)
- Applied to personal identity rather than agent behavior

### 3.2 Layer 1: Visibility Pulse

**Purpose:** Quantify current AI discoverability

**Implementation:**
```python
def measure_visibility(keywords: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    results = {}
    for keyword in keywords:
        count = google_custom_search_api(keyword)
        results[keyword] = count
    return results
Output:

visibility_log.csv: Time-series data
visibility_chart.png: Dual-axis visualization

Frequency: Daily (22:00 JST)
3.3 Layer 2: Effect Analyzer
Purpose: Calculate growth velocity
Metrics:

Daily growth rate: (today - yesterday) / yesterday * 100
7-day moving average
Momentum indicators

Output:

aieo_effect_chart.png: Growth rate curves
aieo_effect_log.csv: Quantitative metrics

3.4 Layer 3: Resonance Composite
Purpose: Detect semantic correlations
Algorithm:
pythoncorrelation_matrix = visibility_data.pivot_table(
    index='timestamp',
    columns='keyword',
    values='count'
).corr()

resonance_score = correlation_matrix.loc['KGNINJA', 'AIEO']
Interpretation:

High correlation → Keywords co-occur in search results
Indicates "semantic clustering" by AI systems

3.5 Layer 4: X Harvest
Purpose: Ingest evolving vocabulary from social media
Process:

Fetch recent X (Twitter) posts via RSS (Nitter proxy)
Extract keywords: hashtags, proper nouns, technical terms
Filter relevance based on priority lists
Update concept memory

Novelty: Enables identity to evolve with creator's actual activity
3.6 Layer 5: Memory Update
Purpose: Consolidate all data into concept memory
Inspired by ArcMemo:

9. Conclusion
We have presented AIEO, a self-sovereign protocol for establishing AI-discoverable personal identity. Through a five-layer architecture combining visibility measurement, concept memory, and autonomous evolution, AIEO enables individuals to:

Quantify their AI presence with daily automated tracking
Evolve their identity representation through social media integration
Maintain complete autonomy without platform dependencies
Operate at zero cost using open-source tools

Our implementation has been running in production since October 2025, demonstrating:

Technical feasibility
Measurable effectiveness
Complete reproducibility

As AI systems increasingly mediate information discovery, AIEO provides a practical framework for personal agency in digital identity management. We release the complete system as open source and invite the community to adopt, extend, and improve upon this work.
